## Description

Hello!  This is my portfolio.  It's a constant WIP as I develop my skills, but I've seen worse.  I made this portfolio using React.js and bootstrap, with a lot of custom components and CSS styling.

## Usage

Once the page is opened, the title in the header is the link back to the 'about' page, and all other pages can be navigated to from the navbar.  The profolio contained a react 3d carousel of my projects.  Click the project title to navigate to the project.  The resume page contains a list of technologies I am familiar with, and a button to download the pdf of my resume...the pdf does not yet exist in my files, but that's easy enough to through in there as soon as I hav the time to do so.  The Lofi page is a music player component to allow people to listen to beats while studying.  The contact page, while non-functional, has the framework to allow prospective employees or other interested parties to contact me.
